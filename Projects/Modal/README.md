# Playing with HTML Classes

## Project Overview
This is a simple Javascript project where we learn how we can manipulate the CSS of HTML classes using JAVASCRIPT at run-time.

## What actually project does
- We have created a 3 buttons on main page using HTML and a box which is initially hidden using display property. 
- Now when any user clicks any of the three buttons the box is displayed using javascript.
- To close the box we can use the cross button (added class using JS), Orby clicking outside the box, and by using ESCAPE
